  # 🎯 Guess My Number

This is a simple number‑guessing game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The player must guess a secret number between **1 and 20**, receiving hints like **“Too high”** or **“Too low”** until the correct number is found.
This is my **fourth project**, focused on improving my JavaScript logic and understanding of **DOM interaction**.

## Features
-  Random number generation  
-  Real‑time feedback (Too high / Too low / Correct)  
-  Dynamic score tracking  
-  High‑score saving (same session)  
-  “Play Again” button for instant restart  

## Built With
- **HTML** – structure  
- **CSS** – basic styling  
- **JavaScript** – game logic and interactivity  


👨‍💻 *Built as part of my JavaScript learning journey.*
